# Pong using DOTS

This project is a simple re-creation of the Unity tutorial on DOTS tech stack which uses Entity Component System (ECS). Specifically, the Data Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) has the following systems:
- ECS
- C# Job System which provides a way to run game code in parallel on multiple CPU cores
- Burst compiler which is a new math-aware, backend compiler used to produce highly optimized machine code
